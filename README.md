### Design
I kept in mind to use only Apples' native elements such as search bar, filter menus, navigation, lists, picker, etc, including SfSymbols. This creates a sense of **familiarity** for iOS users(this is something that Apple is proud of, hence the HIG, Human Interface Guidelines), which makes the app extremely user-friendly. This makes sure that the users don't waste time in learning how the app works rather.. get right into taking advantage of the features that app offers.
